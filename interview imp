you cannot ignore SQL if you want to success in your hashtag#dataanalytics job..
this was the mistake made by me few years ago, due to the heavy learning, lot of tools, technologies i used to skip SQL practising.
the result is obvious, i failed many interviews, just because i am not perfect in writing SQL queries.
