•	My knowledge extends to all the GCP services aspects; worked on Bigquery, GCS, Cloud Function, Cloud composer, cloud Dataflow, cloud Scheduler, cloud pub/sub, cloud logging etc.
•	I have worked on Azure CI/CD pipelines.
•	Taking complete ownership of work items and deliver them..
•	Completed  Azure boards  stories with minimal defects.
•	No rework / defects in the project delivery..
•	Gained Functional expertise in different module areas.
•	Designed and implemented data pipelines to move data from various sources to BigQuery, Cloud Storage using cloud function and composer.
•	Created Cloud Functions to automate data processing tasks and trigger data ingestion workflows.
•	Designed and implemented data modeling techniques to improve query performance and optimize storage in BigQuery.
•	I have been working in the night shifts from past 2 months with negligible leaves. My average shift time lasts for 12+ hours approximately.
•	I work on a shift-wise project that requires me to be available at different times, and I have always been flexible with my schedule to ensure that the project is completed on time and to the satisfaction of the client.
•	I have often gone above and beyond my regular duties to ensure that the project is completed successfully. For example, I have worked extra hours to complete urgent tasks and have been available outside of my regular working hours to resolve any issues that may arise.
Designed and implemented data pipelines to extract data from diverse sources and efficiently load
it into BigQuery and Cloud Storage. Leveraged Cloud Function and Composer to automate data
movement workflows, enhancing data availability and reliability.
•	In my last project we used cloud function to transfer data from Big Query to GCS and GCS to Bigquery later replaced with cloud composer my manager give me responsibility to write a code with Dag and transfer data from BQ to GCS and GCS to BQ using composer with multiple Dag files I completed the task within the given timeframe.

Proficient in using services such as Cloud BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Cloud Function, Dataflow, Cloud
Pub/Sub, Cloud Scheduler, Cloud Logging, and Cloud SQL to build scalable and efficient data
solutions.
